    For some baffling reason StatsCan doesn't include province identifiers in the Population Centres file ...
    StatsCan own documents say,
    "It is recommended that the two-digit province/territory (PR) code precede the POPCTR code in order to
    identify each POPCTR uniquely within its corresponding province/territory."
    https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/dict/geo049a-eng.cfm
    Yet they don't follow this recommendation. 
    At least they provide a semi-reasonable way to get this info
