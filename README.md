This project will estimate a model of pharmacy entry similar to
Bresnehan and Reiss (1991). 

This is a work in progress. Only the data preparation is partially
complete. The main pieces are:
 - pharmacies.jl : scrapes information on pharmacy addresses from provincial websites in
                   Canada
 - census.jl : downloads data on population centres in Canada
 - geo.jl : geocodes pharamacies addresses and populations centres to
            facilitate combining
